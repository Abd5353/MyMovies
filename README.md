<h1>My Movies!</h1>

The My Movies! app is a simple app for users to search for and get some basic information about their favorite movies. Users can also create accounts so they can save their favorite movies.

The app is a native Android app created using Android Studio written in Java.  The app contains 2 databases: Users and Favorite Movies. The API I used to get the list of movies was the ombdAPI.
